# Burger-Bash-Case-Study
I have a started a new business of selling burger because I read on my Instagram feed that „Burger Is the Future!
<>
But I knew that burger alone was not going to help me get seed funding to expand my new Burger Empire - so I had one more genius idea to combine with it - I was going to Uberize it - and so Burger Runner was launched!
I started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh burger from Burger Runner Headquarters and also maxed out my credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.
