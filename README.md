# Burger-Bash-Case-Study
I have a started a new business of selling burger because I read on my Instagram feed that „Burger Is the Future!
<br>
But I knew that burger alone was not going to help me get seed funding to expand my new Burger Empire - so I had one more genius idea to combine with it - I was going to Uberize it - and so Burger Runner was launched!
<br>
I started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh burger from Burger Runner Headquarters and also maxed out my credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

## Questions
1) How many burgers were ordered?
2) How many unique customer orders were made?
3) How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?
4) How many of each type of burger was delivered?
5) How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?
6) What was the maximum number of burgers delivered in a single order?
7) For each customer, how many delivered burgers had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?
8) What was the total volume of burgers ordered for each hour of the day?
9) How many runners signed up for each 1 week period?
10) What was the average distance travelled for each customer?
